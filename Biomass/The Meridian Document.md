**Introduction**  
  My hope in writing this document is to spark a community around this wonderful game I randomly bought and played off steam because it looked cool, but began to completely adore over my 20+ playthroughs of it.  At the time of writing this there is almost no discussion surrounding this game let alone any helpful information so I have done my best to get that ball rolling.  My timeline and theories are my own and if at any point you think I’m full of crap and want to skip over that part feel free, I won’t be offended.  These are just my thoughts and interpretations but my hope is that you can at least glean some interesting ideas from my research\!  What follows the timeline and theories is a cataloging of all the dialogue and item descriptions in the game.  It can be used as a reference guide for theory crafting or whatever you find useful.  I hope someone out there does find it useful\!

**Prehistory**  
  Not much is known about the time before the Metropolitans, and by ‘not much’ I mean there is literally no information on this period.  The greater universe of Biomass is never really discussed within the game and, while one may wonder, I believe that it is of no consequence to the story being told here.

**Metropolis**  
  At some point a precursor civilization became extremely advanced and built the great metropolis the game takes place in. These peoples thus became known as the ‘Metropolitans’ by later generations, as this grand city is the only trace of the mysterious race left.  The city itself seems pretty massive, with the portions we visit in game being only the towers tall enough to be above water (more on this later) or, in the case of West Tower, an apparently water-tight underground structure/submarine, and the rest of the city being submerged by the time we, as players, see it.

**The Lighthouse**  
  ***“*** *My favorite thus far involves an impossible question…  A great being is created to find an impossible answer.  Does it succeed?”*  
\- Enemy Red, South Tower Settlement

  Being advanced as they were, the Metropolitans managed to deduce that a great cataclysm would soon be upon them.   The stars were apparently going to fall out of the sky (more on this in the next section) and they were powerless to stop them.  (This information is not found in game but rather was found as a developer response to a question within the games official discord server, where he was asked if the Metropolitans caused the stars to fall, to which he replied:  “If they had the power to affect them, they surely would still be burning.”  These questions can be found in the Meta Lore section at the end of this document.)  They knew that the Cataclysm was going to be pretty bad so in anticipation of this built the Lighthouse as a final, desperate attempt at survival.

  The nature of the Lighthouse has been something I have been pondering for some time now…  We know for sure the Metropolitans built it (check the Meta Lore questions) and that it’s purpose is to somewhat subvert the Cataclysm but how exactly it actually accomplishes this goal is one of the games biggest mysteries.  I will now attempt to unravel this mystery but at the end of the day I think there is just not enough information available to know for sure, and you will have to draw your own conclusions.  \**Speculation inbound.\**

  We know for sure that the Lighthouse is a scaled up version of the biomass workstations and that the drones are collecting data on EVERYTHING (this includes people, one kid in the South Settlement talks about a bunch of drones surrounded him followed by a flash, and that he felt sick after the experience) around “down to the molecular level” from the Engineer’s dialogues at the end of route 2’s Lighthouse.  We also know that the drones are flying themselves into the eye of the Lighthouse where, according to various NPCs, they are then “destroyed”. We know that the current citizens of Metropolis (the settlers, etc.) rely heavily upon the light to survive (or rather, stay human) and that the Pallid emerge with distance or isolation from it.  (more on the Pallid later but anyone who’s played the game should have a basic understanding of what the Pallid are, at least on a surface level.)  We get all these little tidbits of information from the inhabitants of this ‘sinking city’ but what does it all mean?  What the hell does this damn lighthouse do?  Well what happens if we put all this info together into one theory?  Here’s what I think is going on. 

\**Speculation*\*

  The Lighthouse is literally a giant biomass workstation. When we ask the lady settler in South Tower \- Settlement about the workstations she says you can synthesize “*Pretty much anything as long as you have a schematic”* and enough biomass. You, the PC (player character), indeed, can collect biomass and, provided you have the schematic, use the workstation to not only synthesize items, but enhance yourself as well.  This shows that the workstations can make inanimate objects but also synthesize living organic objects as well, such as the mods we use or the stat boosts the station allows us.  So what happens if you scale that up to say I dunno…. A gargantuan towering lighthouse sized structure?  Well, presumably it could just do the same thing on a larger scale\!  I believe the Metropolitans built the Lighthouse with intent of uploading their entire civilization, along with that of the whole of their city/animals/plants/etc, so they could essentially wait out the cataclysm and re-synthesize life as they knew it back into existence. They used the drones to collect this data and programmed them to fly themselves into the eye of the Lighthouse to be assimilated and stored for later use, when the critical levels of biomass and data have been achieved.

  The Metropolitans themselves then entered the eye of the Lighthouse and, I believe, became the ‘Angels’ we see in game that inhabit it to the present day.  They are currently waiting patiently for this process (not to be confused with the other ‘Process’, more on this later) to complete. 

**The Cataclysm**  
  **“***Ever since the stars fell from the sky, and our people crossed the mountains to this abandoned city, pilgrims yearned to discover the secrets of the bygone metropolitans.”*  
  \-Lady Settler 1, South Tower Settlement

  The stars fell from the sky.  A simple, straightforward tale that is nevertheless shrouded deep in mystery and obfuscation.  As with all things vague, scrutinizing this topic will require a healthy dose of speculation and ‘educated’ guesswork.  As far as my brain can deduce one of two possibilities occurred:

1\.  My, and I’m guessing a lot of peoples, initial response to ‘the stars fell’ was, of course, an asteroid impact.  This theory, while not being particularly exciting, can perfectly explain the origin story of the world we find ourselves in while playing Biomass and can be corroborated with the other information found therein.  The problem with this theory is not found within the game, but instead in a developer response (found in the Meta Lore section, once again) to a question found in the official Discord server’s lore section.

“**Did they really cause them to fall?**  
  If they had the power to affect them, they surely would still be burning.”

  This suggests two things:  The Metropolitans were NOT the cause of the cataclysm (as stated as a possibility by a certain NPC) and that the stars are no longer burning.  If we take this to be true (the game was developed by one dude, if anyone knows what happens in this story, it’s him), and I’m going to assume it is for the purposes of this document, then that means people are talking about literal stars, like the sun.  This presents another possibility…

2\.  The stars are gone.  This could mean a bunch of things but the most likely, to me, would be something like the sun dying, or some kind of cosmic event ‘ejecting’ the planet out of orbit and into deep space.   Perhaps the sun died but instead of supernova-ing became a dwarf star and ‘fell from the sky’ could be interpreted as the sun simply going out.  I am but a simple layman so my theory here could be really off base but we ARE talking about a highly advanced civilizations technology.  Technology we don’t understand is essentially magic, and magic can solve problems otherwise unsolvable to modern conventions.

  In the case of an asteroid impact we can assume that the leftover debris and pollution blotted out the sun but in either case one thing seems pretty clear:  The sun/stars are no longer providing the needed light and sustenance for life to continue and that the Lighthouse, among other things, appears to be some sort of artificial sun.  

  After ‘the stars fell from the sky’ it seems pretty obvious to me that what followed was a flood of biblical proportions…  A Deluge of sorts.  This could obviously be the result of asteroid impacts (see the 1998 film Deep Impact for inscrutable scientific PROOF of this :P) but also, on account of the fact that sea level and tides, etc. are affected by the gravity of celestial bodies, would likely happen in the second scenario as well.   The evidence for this can be found all over the game if you look closely, which we will proceed to do now. 

  For one, there is water everywhere.  The area outside the Lighthouse on Route 2 is titled ‘The Flood’ and it is indeed shallow water  you walk on there and all around West Tower.  According to a settler in East Tower Settlement “*The first place their”* (ancestors) *“boats docked was the east tower.”.*  It’s interesting to note also that the only areas we visit in game are tall structures, such as towers and lighthouses \- structures that would not be completely consumed by a flood, and we indeed use boats to travel between areas.  The exception, of course, is West Tower.

  West Tower is an ‘underground compound’ that is in one way or another watertight.  An interesting idea I had at one point was that this place looks like it might be contained within the empty remains of a submarine but upon further inspection of the area I feel like I could be wrong.  In any case West Tower is actually found below the surface level of the water and is the most technologically advanced part of Metropolis (except probably the lighthouse) so we can assume that they somehow subverted the effects of the flood with said technology.  

**Settling Metropolis**  
  So there was this great flood.  It makes sense, then, that the people who did survive were those who dwelt in the mountains.  They were likely a tribalistic people, perhaps hunter-gatherers, but whatever the case they were much less advanced than the Metropolitans.  After the light faded and the lands flooded they were drawn to the lighthouse \-  The last vestige of light and life left to them.  They descended the mountains and settled the now empty Metropolis, starting with the East Tower.  Over time the entire city was colonized and civilization began to once again thrive.  

  With civilization comes opinion and with opinions comes discord, and so many factions were founded and spread themselves to the different towers of Metropolis.  The South Tower settlers became a simpler, spiritual sort of people that took great faith in the light of the Lighthouse and formed somewhat of a religious cult based around its worship.  The West Tower seems to be where the Engineers are from, and obviously where we find the Duke and the West Tower Military enemies with rockets and armor (they seem to generally have better tech) and so we can deduce that they were the scientific subset of society.  The East Tower seems to be more of a political or militarily driven society.  The Drifter tells us before we arrive at East Tower that “*The unfortunate conditions there only allowed the most ruthless to thrive.”*, suggesting that due to internal conflicts and other problems they were likely the least civilized/advanced of the factions, at least until their alliance with the West Tower (more on this later).

   One NPC says “*Ah… I wonder if it will ever be like the old days…  Making excursions to other settlements…  Trading books, trading stories…”*  adding credence to the idea that this time was a time of flourishing and rebuilding of society and knowledge.

  …Or at least it was until the land was assaulted by a slow and creeping rot that began to take root.

**The Pallid**  
  *“… They took our lights away.  … and now we are gone.  ..I am standing on the precipice..  …I can’t collect my thoughts?”*  
\-Light Deprived, The First Settlement

  Eventually people became so reliant on the light from The Lighthouse that any form of separation or isolation from it would cause horrific anomalies and produce the Pallid creatures we see in game.  Once the new citizens of Metropolis began to notice this phenomenon there was likely some panic setting in.  They surely would look to the smartest among them for answers and, more importantly, solutions.

  There is evidence to suggest that they were inspired to begin researching this phenomenon.  The Light Deprived filled Pods found around West Tower area, the Pallid bosses are named ‘Sans Lumier’ with one emerging from a pod and another being Sans Lumier IV \- The Marionette found near The Dukes Manor in the transit tunnels and is clearly up to something suspicious concerning the Hybrid Engineer, the Duke’s Left Hand who is referred to directly as both a lackey and a Pallid hybrid…. These all seem to be the results of a dark path of research and they are all somehow related to The Duke. 

  As an aside, The Duke is an interesting can of worms all by himself.  The Old Man Engineer says he is his brother and that The Duke was exiled due to his actions.  I get mad Dark Souls 2 vibes when thinking about these two because it is very reminiscent of the relationship of Aldia and King Vendrick.  I speculate that The Duke was likely the one to first begin the research into the corruption and probably was the one to begin the research that led to things like the Pallid/Human hybrids and the Light Deprived filled Pods.  This research is presumably what got him exiled in the first place.  It’s possible that the other towers were already settled and when they exiled The Duke he was forced to find an alternate place to do his research and so located the underground compound that later became known as the West Tower and founded the new faction.  A faction in support of the messed up research he was conducting.

 I believe The Duke and the Old Man Engineer worked together on researching the corruption in order to somehow overcome it.  We know that this research was pretty controversial from the fact that The Duke was exiled and also from certain NPC dialogues.

“*…I can see why they kicked that old fossil out…  ..we all turned a blind eye…”*  
\-Lady Settler, South Tower Vestige

“*So off I went with him.  I turned a blind eye to a lot of his actions…”*  
\-Old Man Engineer, Transit Tunnels

  What seems to be the case, at least, is that around this time is when the Human/Pallid hybrids were created.  Red Mother was probably the first, given her name it seems likely that she was created and somehow used as a template or the foundation for creating the other Hybrids.  She shares similarities to the PC, being able to use repair and being particularly apt in combat and a variety of weapons. The PC seems to be the ultimate result of this endeavor but with a specific purpose also built in (more on this later).  We know the PC is a hybrid thanks to many reasons with the most obvious being the Beamsabre’s description that outright talks about our ‘pallid flesh’.  
    
  It would make sense to be researching for a cure or solution to the problem but it appears that is not what they discovered.  Perhaps they spiraled into despair because they couldn’t find one, or learned it was impossible.  It is possible they learned of the cycle, or of the nature of the Lighthouse and how to progress it to the next stage, but in any case it appears that this realization, whatever it was, seems to have pushed The Duke over the precipice of the abyss and deep into insanity.  In a massive power play he devised a scheme to remove the one source preventing complete degradation…  He was going to unpower the Lighthouse\! Blue Enemies in the East Tower say the light inside their masks “*pain”* their *“brain*(s) *and fill”* them *“with rage…”*  which suggests to me not only a way to continue living without the lighthouse but also a form of control for The Duke and his regime to manipulate the human soldiers.  His other soldiers, the Pallid, the Light Deprived, and even the Duke’s Left Hand are likely already loyal due to his hand in creating them in the first place.  He created an alliance with the citizens of East Tower, giving them weapons and technology, and manipulated them into attacking South Tower.  This would accomplish not only control of all the factions but also provide a great source of fuel and test subjects via the farming of South Tower and The First Settlement peoples.  

  A devious plan indeed.  It would seem however that not everyone agreed with taking such extreme measures…

**The Schism**  
  **\*I feel at this point, before I continue, that it is worth reiterating the fact that this document is, as a natural part of an interpretive work, massively speculative and I claim no authority on the events of this story.  By now I am balls deep into speculation and many of my theories now are contingent themselves on other theories and well… I don’t intend to stop this far in\!\***

 This  led to a schism of ideologies within the remnants of humanity.  Those who supported the Lighthouse and those who wanted to embrace corruption and live as the ‘dark lords’ of humanity a la Dark Souls usurp the fire ending.  I mean, if you can’t beat the Pallid you might as well embrace it right?  And if you’re gonna embrace the new, lightless world then you may as well be the ones in power for it, right?  

  I believe the Old Man Engineer, learning of his plans and leaving to continue searching for another solution, used the knowledge he learned while researching with The Duke to create us, the PC,  to subvert his plan to unpower the Lighthouse.  The nature of the PC is not explicitly stated but the Old Man Engineer does refer to us as “*My Child”* and he seems to be the only person aware of who or what we are when we talk to him.  He can also somehow absorb and scan our memories or something so it seems obvious that he at least has a major role in our creation.  Whether we are a completely artificially created being or an experimental human/pallid hybrid is unclear as well as our what our actual purpose is, but I believe the PC, along with the Old Man Engineers own version of the Meridian Gate (found in the basement of his house), and the Meridian Sequence, were created with the intent of somehow rebooting the Process. 

  Another possibility is that maybe we were created by both the Old Man Engineer and The Duke together but the duke changed his mind and devised his plan to instead subvert the original plan of ‘progressing’ the Lighthouse by shutting it off before we get there.  It’s a bit of a chicken or egg first kind of situation I suppose.

  What happens here is not obvious but to me it seems like the PC is a piece of ‘bio-code’ or a ‘bio-script’ so to speak, that when assimilated into the Lighthouses triggers it to ‘progress’ to whatever the ‘next stage’ of the Process looks like.  We try to accomplish this by entering the Lighthouse’s apex but are thwarted by The Duke's plan and are forced to resort to using the Meridian Sequence \- a failsafe created to somehow force load something into the Lighthouse.  

  Whatever it is that actually occurs here *seems* to reboot The Lighthouse to a backup state akin to say a Windows system restore snapshot and this event *seems* to be the primal, causal incident of the Cycle.

**The Cycle**  
  *“The truth of this world…  Would drive it’s denizens mad…  But they are all but a long gone memory…  Gone… but not forgotten.  I can’t say what caused this memory to be restored…  But it seems to be at least somewhat conscious”*  
\-Old Man Engineer, Transit Tunnels

  Ah, we have arrived at last…  The Cycle, indeed the crux of the matter itself.  All of Biomass revolves around this central idea and yet it is also the hardest idea to define.  The most elusive.  All we really know is that we enter the Meridian Sequence and everything repeats.  

  What little community discussion that has been had about this topic seem to unanimously agree that the nature of the Cycle is that of a computer simulation on repeat.  After all, what else could explain the nature of a time loop?  The weirdness with the PC being absorbed into machines and reassembled? The Distorted Man and other forms of corruption?  Well what if I told you there was another way?  That we could use all our clues, in game and out, to weave together a narrative that perfectly explains all of Biomass and leaves it’s deepest mysteries laid bare\! Well I’d be lying for sure hue hue, but that is of course my aspirational goal with this document and indeed I do have some ideas in mind for this topic.  

“**What is the relationship between drones and the lighthouse?**  
  You might find a parallel process occurring in game, though in a more compact manner.”  
\-Developer Response, Meta Lore

  I believe Bfar is talking about the Biomass Workstations we use to level up and respawn.  In this analogy we, the PC, are the drone and the workstation is The Lighthouse and indeed, we do behave like a drone in the sense that we roam around the world collecting biomass and end up taking it back to the workstation.  This is also corroborated by the dialogue of one of the engineers from The Lighthouse during route 2, when you enter from West Tower:

 “*I can’t quite understand it…  But some of the programming code in these terminals…  Is identical to sections of a biomass workstation…  What the hell is the purpose of this thing?”*

  If I’m correct and this is the analogy he’s going for then we also have to look at what we do once we return to the workstation, synthesize items.  We can take random biomass from the environment and enemies and turn it into pretty much unrelated stuff like repair kits and grenades but perhaps of more interesting note are the mods we can synthesize as well as the fact that we can upgrade our stats with it, essentially fusing the biomass into ourselves to empower us.  The Shady Dealer from West Tower says *“What?  You think this is from a living organ?”* when we talk to him the second time, suggesting that the mods are in some sense alive, or at least living tissue.  We also have another engineer from outside The Lighthouse on route 2:

*“* *I am not sure yet…  But it seems that the data scanned by the drones…  It’s all stirpped and stored within.  It’s just that it’s so much data\!  Down to the molecular level…”*

  *“Down to the molecular level”.*  Hmm.. Now it’s getting interesting.  The Lighthouse is the same as the workstations and the workstations can manufacture living biomass entities. It follows, then, that The Lighthouse itself could manufacture biomass entities but on a much larger scale and also down to the molecular level, preserving the biological data so to speak.

  What I’m suggesting is that the Cycle is in fact a physical absorption and reconstruction of Metropolis and its inhabitants at the molecular level and completely.  The Drones fly around, collect data and biomass, and return to the lighthouse to be absorbed.  Sure they are destroyed in the process but it’s of no consequence because they are simply serving the function of continuing the cycle and will be created anew when the cycle repeats. Some citizens of Metropolis even have memories of this happening, saying things like *“we merge, we come apart”*  and  *“we’ll be one”*.  The Light Deprived that say this seem to be going insane with this knowledge, smashing their heads in agony and are all desynced from The Lighthouse (aka isolated from the light, aka Pallid).  Others who are aware of the Cycle, like those citizens in West Tower in route 2, while The Lighthouse is still on, that talk about *“Cycle anniversary”* parties, seem to be perfectly fine with this knowledge.  Perhaps they only ‘know’ of the cycle while the ones who are insane actually retain their memories from it.  Perhaps it is the light that keeps them blind to the truth.

  The Old Man Engineer says *“We will be thrown into another dark age…  And the cycle will repeat again.”*  which suggests that whatever the ‘dark age’ *is,* it is part of the Cycle.  It seems to me the ‘dark age’ being referred to here is when the Duke shuts the lighthouse off.  This is why I place the Cycle here on the timeline, because if the Lighthouse turning off is part of the Cycle then the Cycle couldn’t have begun until the first time the Duke did so, therefore I believe this event is the inciting incident that kickstarted the whole thing to begin with.

**The Corruption**  
  **“***With time, everything decays…  And that which doesn’t adapt…  Will inevitably be corrupted”*  
  \-Old Man Engineer, Transit Tunnels.  
    
  The timeline here is unclear.  How much time passed before the corruption began?  The Old Man Engineer seems to suggest it takes a lot of time for corruption to begin, and if we think of data stored on the harddrive of a computer it does indeed become corrupted over time.  However we also know that it hasn’t been more than one lifetime since the cataclysm to current in-game events because the old people of the game (Red Mother, The Duke, Old Man Engineer) were allegedly around during the time of settlers, at least according to certain NPC dialogue.  Another factor is how long the people lingered in the mountains before deciding to settle Metropolis. 

  But wait, perhaps we should first discuss what exactly the Corruption *is* before moving on.  To be frank I really don’t know.  This is one of those big mysteries the game presents us with.  Let’s unpack it as best we can with limited information…

  All we really have to go on is the Old Man Engineer’s dialogue about ‘the distortion’ and he pretty much only says that time is the culprit. Of Interest, he mentions the ‘*curse*’ will ‘*burden you with the mistakes of the past*’ and the fact that the corrupted version of the PC goes around murdering everyone suggests that the likely place for the Corruption on the timeline is after the Cycle begins, and being tethered to a cycle is what causes it to take long enough to allow the Corruption to take hold.

  It also seems like the Corruption is relatively specific to the PC with the only other place I remember it being is the Drone Blade, suggesting perhaps instead that everything is corrupted since they fly everywhere and would spread it around. But nevertheless The Distorted Man and The Lost Process are both versions of the PC that are Corrupted because they are not ‘in sync’ with the current version (the PC).  The Distorted Man goes around killing everyone which is apparently your ‘*mistakes of the past*’ and The Lost Process seems to be the ‘uncorrupted’ version of you that’s leftover from the Unity ending.  It’s all rather meta, because it seems to me that the fact we load our game after it shouldn’t be possible (since the Process is now complete via the Unity ending and the world should be absorbed/moved on to the ‘next stage) is what actually causes The Lost Process to appear…  We load our game back to a state right before we achieve unity and kill that version of ourselves before they can ascend and the reason it appears corrupted but not dark is because WE are what’s wrong, not it.  It’s essentially a glitch in the Process that is overwriting itself or something like that.

  To wrap this part up I would just say that time is change, and when enough change occurs between a thing and let’s say, the perfect form of that thing, it’s platonic essence, the original data…. It becomes Corrupted.

**In Game Events**  
  So that brings us to in-game events, with the Old Man Engineer somehow creating us to undo the stagnating Cycle set in motion by his brother, The Duke.  We wake up after an indeterminate amount of Cycle’s have passed and are on our way to progressing the Process\!

Ever since the stars fell from the sky, and our people crossed the mountains to this abandoned city, pilgrims yearned to discover the secrets of the bygone metropolitans.  Now though, the powers (th)at be have closed access to the settlement.  You’re the first foreigner I’ve seen in a long time.*  
  **(The South Tower)** *Our little settlement here might be humble, not much metropolitan infrastructure survived…  But the damage to the building has blessed us with nourishing light.  The Red Mother and legion have taken good care of us.  Youths joined her ranks and hunted for biomass in the tunnels.  They would escort tourists to the west tower before the link closed.  Lately, security has tightened a lot.  Very few people have been allowed in or out of the settlement.  I wonder what’s going on?*  
  **(Workstations)**  *Biomass workstations allow us to synthesize objects.  Pretty much anything as long as you have a schematic…  and a good amount of biomass as well\!  I hear that biomass itself can be compressed at a workstation, strengthening its properties.  Vitality will expand durability.  Endurance upgrades increase stamina.  Technical Skill upgrades melee strength.  Mechanical Knowledge increases firearm strength.*  
  **(Nothing)**  *Take care of yourself, pilgrim\!*

**Lady with drone 1**  
  *Some officers managed to trap this drone…  We’ve been doing some research.  And by that I mean we’ve just been vacantly looking at it\!  Hahaha ha\!  But yes.  We have made some observations\!  In contrast to the rest of the technology in this city..  It looks ancient in comparison.  Where could it have come from?*

**Lady with drone 2**  
  *Look at it\!  It’s so determined to continue its trajectory.  Like all the others…  To the eye of the lighthouse.  I just don’t get it.  They get consumed by the fireball.  The same fireball that gives us life.  Seems rather pointless…  Doesn’t it?*

**Disillusioned Red**  
  **(red outfit)**  *Piss Off\!*  

  **(other outfit)**  *Huh?  You’re allowed up here?  …  Maybe you slaughtered your way through the building?  Hahaha\!  I guess you must be one of the new recruits?  Maybe you’ll do better than me…  I’m just not cut out for this stuff.  I am much more suited for guarding this hallway\!  Hehehe.  I can’t give you my uniform as I’ll be left in my jocks\!  But you can take my battering ram.  I accidentally whacked myself in the head with it\!  Haven’t felt quite the same since…*

**Lady Settler 2 (Peak)**  
  *Security has tightened a lot around here…  The view of the lighthouse from atop the citadel was breath taking*\!  *Can’t believe they blew out the floor here…  If only I had myself one of those fancy rope wheels…*

**Male Settler 1 (next to Hybrid Engineer)**  
  *I can’t believe it\!  Such exciting news.  A joint expedition\!  Perhaps sometime soon…  The west tower will open its doors to us again\!*

**Hybrid Engineer**  
  **(red outfit)**  *Hello there\!  Keep up the good work\!*  
  **(other)**  *Ah, a pilgrim…If you’re allowed up here you must be somewhat trustworthy.  You wouldn't be happening to be going east, would you pilgrim?  My children, bless them, have been running amok.  They think this sinking city can by (be) saved,  by fixing a couple of switches and machinery here and there.  Now, I don’t mean to dump my responsibilities on someone else \- But I am here on the cusp of something unfathomable\!  I really don’t have a choice…  If you manage to cross paths with them, would you keep an eye on them for me?*  
  **(Yes)** *Thanks pilgrim, I am in your debt\!*  
  **(No)**  *Ah, all good pilgrim, I know it’s a lot to ask of you.  I wish you well.*

**Lady Settler 3 (with book)**  
  *When the stars fell from the sky…  And our ancestors made their trek over the mountains…  The first place their boats docked was the east tower.  Gradually, the rest of the city was populated.  Those who remained behind were driven down \- down to a damp, barely lit abyss.  I mean, that’s what that old kook next door has told me.  I am inclined to believe him.  He looks like he was probably around back then\!  He he he he.  Come to think of it, haven’t seen him around for a while.  I wonder what he’s up to.*

**Lady Settler 4 (by children)**  
  *I am so proud of our settlement…  Through our vast, open edifice…  Each corner soaked with more light than the one before…  We’ve done nothing but prosper\!  There’s just something special about us\!  We made the choice to better ourselves…  Every other settlement should feel inspired from what we’ve achieved\!*

**Child 1**  
  *I saw it\!  All the drones just stopped, and hovered in place* *\- suddenly a flash of light burst forth from each one\!  I felt a bit wheezy afterwards…  But I am all good now\!*

**Child 2**  
  *Why are you talking to me?  Go away\!*

**Male Settler**  
  *I once was part of a tour to the first settlement…  Urgh…  What a disgusting place…  A dark, decrepit pit that goes on and on…  Pathetic villagers squabbling over a pittance of artificial light…  While the militia lay claim to the light soaked apex…  We’d never let anyone push us around like that\!  They had a choice to fight or submit, and they chose the latter\!  They have no one to blame but themselves\!*

**Lady Settler 5** (back turned)  
  *My grandmother would often recount the tale…  of how the drones flooded the heavens.  And the next day the stars had fallen from the sky.  What kind of omen are we faced with now?*

**Lady Settler 6** (far east)  
  *Many drifters used to pass through here.  Especially after the connection to the west tower was severed.  But now, they aren’t even letting anyone through here.  Is there something going on with the east tower?*

**Naked Red**  
  *Ah… Oh\!  I didn’t realize we were allowing people down here again\!  If I knew I certainly wouldn’t have gotten caught like this\!  Please don’t tell anyone I am here, nourishing myself fat\!  And please don’t take my gear\!*

**Enemy Reds**  
  *Those double Beamsabres look so intimidating\!  I’d probably do half the work for the pallid, and slice myself real good with it\!*

  *I can’t wait to slice up some pallids\!*

  *Have you heard about what’s going on at the east tower?  I heard we are coordinating an assault there.  At this stage only captains have been given the task.  A savage gang of beasts leading a monstrous populace.  No doubt they would love to take our light soaked territory.  Envious cretins.*

  *Everyone seems to hold the metropolitans responsible,  They think they messed with something they shouldn’t have…  Caused the stars to fall from the sky…  And left things the way they are now.  I don’t know if I believe it…  In any case they all seem to be gone.  Every one of them.  Not a trace since our ancestors' fleet arrived here.  Where could they have gone?*

  *Not long now friend.  Soon we’ll seel (still?) be see (ing) some real action in the tunnels\!  I can’t wait\!*

  *I am in awe of those things…  Flying to the eye of the lighthouse.  An almost never ending swarm…  confidently heading to their doom.  I wish I shared their courage.*

  *I’ve got a theory on what the pallids are.  I don’t know if I should say, it sounds a bit wacky…  Yeah . . . Nah.  I ain’t telling you.*

  *The story of the night the stars fell from the sky…  It used to terrify me as a boy\!  I never knew if it was real or not …  Now seeing all the drones in the sky like the story…  It fills me with an insurmountable dread…*

  *Why do we even call them pallids?  We are more pale than them\!  I feel like I am losing my mind\!*

  *It’s so liberating leaving the settlement.  I’ve spent my whole life there doing nothing.  I didn’t think I would but I love forging my own path in life.*

  *I’ve been stuck here for so bloody long.  Day in day out, standing by this window waiting for something to happen.  I think they took pity on me after what happened to us in the tunnels.  …*  

  *Ah… I wonder if it will ever be like the old days…  Making excursions to other settlements…  Trading books, trading stories…  How I long for those times.*  

  *I can’t understand how she wields her scythe so freely.  That thing looks bulky but she wields it like a dagger\!*

  *This one is a collection of stories.  My favorite thus far involves an impossible question…  A great being is created to find an impossible answer.  Does it succeed?  Hehe, I won’t spoil it for you.*

  *This tale is particularly humorous.  A man devotes himself to his calling…  Rises to the upper echelons of his profession…  Resigns when he sees the inherent meaninglessness of it all…  Then drowns on (in) a lake while taking care of a child.  Heh, ain’t it just like that\!*

  *I’ve just been made an officer\!  I tried many times before…  but I could never quite pass the requirements.  Some are spreading rumors that standards have been laxed…  Miserable bastards.*

  *Between the two of us, I had no desire to become a recruit.  I just couldn’t stand it in the settlement anymore.  If I hadn’t left I probably would have killed my noisy neighbors\!  To be honest, the recruit quarters aren’t much better.  I am on my last tether.*

  *The lighthouse is so mesmerizing…  I was born well after the stars fell from the sky… I wonder what it was like before then?*

  *It was crushing when the west tower made their decision… And cut the rope link between us.  I still don’t understand why…*

  *Ah the lighthouse, bathing us with warmth and life\!  The brightness must be blinding at its apex\!*

  *Did you know the west tower isn’t even a tower?  It’s actually a below ground compound\!  Ah how I miss its neon soaked glow.*

**Red/Pallid Hybrid Enemies**  
  *Sorry brother, no one can go past without authorization.  Maybe talk to the Red Mother if you want to join the effort.*  
   
  *Something on your mind, conrade?  Go on through and talk to her.  She will ease your weary mind.*

  *Let me stop you before you say something unbecoming.  I am NOT the result of some underground experiment…  I am NOT  half human/half pallid hybrid…  I am just tall, OK\!  …  Leave my sight and continue whatever menial duty you are assigned to.  No,  I am not two guys in a suit, smart guy\!  You’re testing my patience,  I am warning you…  Leave me be.  I will crush you like the bug you are\!*  

**Red Mother**  
  **(Other)**  *Not sure what your business is child.  No doubt there’s places you need to be.  I won’t even ask how you got in here…  I pity your situation…  But no one is getting past while I still live.  Go on your way.*  
  **(Red outfit)** *Nice disguise you got there…  But you’re no child of mine. It’s best you make your way with haste…  Before my mood turns to something less forgiving.*  
  **(Familiar outfit)**  *That hat, those rags…  Where did you get them from?*  
    **(I looted them)**  *I thought as much.  I pity your situation…  But no one is getting past while I still live.  Go on your way.*  
    **(I found them)**  *I thought as much.  I pity your situation…  But no one is getting past while I still live.  Go on your way.*  
    **(They were given to me)**  *Is that so?  And who was the charitable fellow…  who handed them to you?*  
      **(A duke)**  *Hah\!  That thin pale man didn’t get to where he is by giving things away\!  I pity your situation…  But no one is getting past while I still live.  Go on your way.*  
      **(A nobody)**  *A nobody, you say…  How has he been?*  
        **(Lost in despair)**  *Do not palter with your words to me\!  I pity your situation…  But no one is getting past while I still live.  Go on your way.*  
        **(Planning and optimizing)**  *…  If you see him again, tell him I am on my way…  He he he…*  
        **(Missing you)**  *Do not palter with your words to me\!  I pity your situation… But no one is getting past while I still live.  Go on your way.*  
      **(A drifter)**   *I thought as much…  I pity your situation… but no one is getting past while I still live.  Go on your way.*

**Drifter**  
  **(Red outfit)**  *Greetings, Officer\!  Let us not underestimate each other.*  
  **(Familiar Outfit)**  *Ah, greetings comrade\!  The eastern wind howls for your presence it seems.  The ruling faction that awaits you is not a pleasant one…  The unfortunate conditions there only allowed the most ruthless to thrive.  Luckily for you, they are defending an assault from this very tower.  Swallow your foolish pride and blend in with the Red Mother’s legion.  A fella like you needs all the friends he can get\!  Hue hue hue hue hue\!  I too have some business east…  I will enjoy the view here for a bit longer before making my approach.  Ah, look at you, staring at me like that?  Expecting a reward for some banter\!  Receive this well and make sure it keeps you alive\!  Hue hue hue\!  Hue hue hue hue hue\!*

**Lazy Soldier**  
  *What do we have here?*

	**East Tower \- Peak**  
   
**Enemy Reds**  
  *The people in the village below…  Something is seriously wrong with them.  I find them so repulsive, I almost pity them.*

  *I am not sure why these beasts turned on us…  They’ve let us go past hundreds of times, and now they won’t let us return home\!  Has something changed?  Luckily a few of us made it back…  I guess you’re part of the cavalry?*

  *I can’t believe we managed to map a route to the lighthouse\!  I wonder what our boys have found there…  Are they the first to walk inside the eternal lighthouse?*  
	\*this is strange…  pilgrims are commonly known to pilgrimage to the lighthouse   
	 and yet this dude seems to think no one’s been inside of it?\*

  *Ah I wish I was back at Drifter’s Den.  I’ll never forget our parting drinks.  I hope the guys made it past The Shore ok.*

  *I thought we would have had reinforcements by now…*

**Red/Pallid Hybrid Enemies**  
  *Nice work there\!*

  *I really want to get back and tell everyone about our discovery\!  I can finally prove to my father I am not a complete waste of space\!*

  *A prominent researcher of The West Tower…  He contributed greatly to mapping a safe path to the lighthouse.  I heard he is the duke’s nephew…  Perhaps he isn’t the insufferable man I’ve always heard he was?*

**Drifter**  
  *Brother\!  I was hoping our paths would cross once again.  I have slayed the beast here for you.  Ah, but why the sad disposition?  Don’t tell me…  It’s because you were denied the sport of battle?  Hue hue hue hue hue\!  Perhaps you shouldn’t have made an allegiance…  with such an efficient killer such as I\!  Oh, brother.*

**Duke’s Left Hand**  
  **(Red outfit)**  *Ah, another one of you beacon blessing peasants.  You’re not worthy of disrupting my introspection.  Go along your merry way.  Someone appropriately insignificant can deal with you.*  
  **(Familiar outfit)**  *No need to be nervous there, friend.  I am but a medicine man caught between two warring gangs of thieves.  I will swallow my pride and humbly beseech you for help clearing the way.*  
    **(If already killed reds)**  *What’s that you say?  The killing has been done?  Ah, no need to run then.  Let us savour the moment and admire the view.  Ah, doesn’t the light look good over the sea?*  
    **(Let’s go)**  *Let’s cease their pain…*  
      **(after killing reds)**  *To die in battle or to die in vain.  These fortunate fools had the honour of the former.  Ah, doesn’t the light look good over the sea?*  
    **(Not right now)**  *No matter then.  I’ll send them to their graves after I deal with you\!  \*attacks\**

**Engineer Sisters**  
  *Maybe this one?  Hmmm…  Looks dead behind the eyes…  but we don’t have a choice… so yes, he will do…  Why, hello there sir\!  No doubt you have important business to attend to…  and have no time to deal with a faulty terminal locking you out\!  It just happens that me and my sister here like to fix things…  If you promise to protect us while we make our way down, we will open this barrier and any other ones we run into.  We’ll be very helpful\!*    
  **(Sure)**  *Ah, that’s great\!  Let me get my tool ready… Err… Just give me a moment…. Ummm…  It’s ok.  Stepback.   Pay closer attention this time.*    
  **(No, I will not)**  *Oh, that’s alright…  Coward\!*

	**Prototype Link Station**

**Engineer Sisters**  
  *Eww what is this stuff?  You’ll be ok.  Keep going.  I am doing fine\!  I was just making conversation. …  You know, if you had given me a little more time…  I could have opened that door.  I am sure you could have.  But we want to move through here as quick as possible.  I’ll handle it from here and just pay closer attention this time.  …  You’ve been as useful as you’ve been talkative, drifter.  If we run into trouble, I hope you can prove your worth.  I HATE elevators.  Heh.  I tell you what… We find a 30 storey ladder we’ll take it.  But you’re carrying my backpack\!  Very funny\!  No way.  I am not walking through there.  Let’s do it together.  …  Don’t panic.  I’ll have it running in no time.  I’ve got this…  Just relax…  Any second…   DAMN DAMN DAMN\!  …  Heh. Maybe you can handle the next interface.  The walls seem to be getting fleshier the deeper we go.  Yeah.  We’re almost there.  The processor room should be coming up.  Alright drifter…  We will wait here for you.  There should be a terminal just up ahead.  It should release most of the locks in the building, including the elevator…  Good luck.*

**Light Deprived 1**  
  *… They took our lights away.  … and now we are gone.  ..I am standing on the precipice..  …I can’t collect my thoughts?  …the destitutes on the ground level…  …they’ve never relied on the lights…  …perhaps they can answer your questions?*

**Light Deprived 2**  
  *…hue hue hue…  …children…  …there’s children here…  …look at the little children playing…*

**Light Deprived 3**  
  *…are you taking me to the happy place?  …am I going on a happy pod?  …I think you already took someone close to me before?  …I can’t remember.*

  *…am I a lucky one?  …will I be put on (in?) a pod?  …will I serve a greater purpose?*

    **(Yes)**  *Stay close and we’ll be ok.*  
      **(when all enemies are killed)**  *Not bad, not bad at all.  This old timer is impressed\!  May your journey onwards be fruitful.  I have my own business to attend to…  Farewell.*

**Pale Child 1**  
  *If anyone comes in here, I’ll smash them\!  Even if it’s a big scary pallid, I don’t care.  Especially if it’s one of those mean men.  They aint takin’ me like they took daddy\!*

**Pale Child 2**  
  *Life has been miserable here for a long time.  It definitely got worse when the blackouts began, though.*

**Pale Child 3**  
  *There’s hardly any of us left now.  If we hadn’t wisened up surely we’d be gone too.  Moving to the slums hasn’t been easy…  But the brutish pallids here keep them away.*

**Pale Child 4**  
  *When our ancestors first arrived…  They arrived at this tower first…  As they expanded and colonized other towers…  They forgot about us…*

**Castlevania Dude**  
  *Ahoy there lad\!  You’re a pale fella, aren’t ya?  Back in my home, there were fellas like you.  Worshiping a great worm or something.  Eventually they took over the whole settlement.  You don’t look the type though.  I must say though…  They sang some catchy chants\!  Didn’t care for the lyrics though\!  Hahahaha\!  Ah,  where I’m from lad… Twas nothing like these tall, towering structures\!  We had none of these elevators and ladders to get around.  If you wanted to get places, you’d better know how to jump\!  Look at those tiny little calves…  You wouldn’t make it one day, my lad\!  Hahahaha\!*

**Grey Coat**  
  *You’re on the pilgrimage, aren’t you?  I can tell…  To the heart of the lighthouse…  I too, was once a pilgrim.  The lighthouse bathed our island settlement with its warmth…  I wanted to feel it up close.  Arriving here though, seeing the fate of the not so blessed…  My pilgrimage didn’t seem so important no more.  …*

**Drifter**  
  *Comrade…  What is this house you’ve come to roam, you wonder?  Many would come through this building on their travels…  For what this tower lacked in natural beauty and resource, it made up with historical resonance…  On their way out they would stop by here before heading on…  Eventually this place became known as Drifter’s Den.  Things, are different now in this tower….  This is what happens to a society when it’s starved of light.  And yet, this place remains \- where we can let our guard down for a time, in the same place our forefathers first arrived \- To this bygone, forgotten, stinking city.  Our paths seem to be heading towards the same end…  I imagine our purposes must be different though…  In any case, we are in luck\!  It seems that an excursion has mapped a route…  A route to our very destination.  Just go on forth…  I am sure the seas will part in anticipation for your arrival\!  Hue hue hue hue hue\!  You go on right ahead…  I will savour the moment a little longer.  For when that boat departs,  I will give all that I have to give\!  Hue hue hue hue hue\!*

  *Sorry, this is a restricted area.  Please move along.*

**Military Guard 2**  
  *You may admire the duke’s gardens…  But his manor is closed to the public for now…  Please move along.*

  *Everyone is so excited for the upcoming Cycle Anniversary party\!  It’s going to be killer\!*

**Drinker 1**  
  *All these festivities seem a bit over the top…  Especially if the rumours about the power shortage are true…  How will our city sustain itself if the furnace ain’t got no fuel?*

**Standing Drinker 1**  
  *I am really looking forward to the big party\!  But I can’t help feel a bit sad about the other settlements…  I wish there was something I could do to help them.*

**Drinker 2**  
  *The troopers do very little around here…  Aside of course from making sure everyone is in line.  That old bastard doesn’t think we realize…  That the troopers are mainly here to look after him and his interests.  Heh.  He keeps the place in order though so I am happy to not rock the boat.*

**Hooded Citizen 1**  
  *It’s been awhile since they’ve let anyone up on the surface…  I love the city…  But sometimes you want the warmth of the lighthouse on your skin\!*

**Umbrella Man**  
  *I can’t stand being lectured to about our supposed responsibilities\!  It’s not my fault the other towers are oppressed\!  We don’t have a choice, we have to live our own lives\!  Their problems can’t reach us, so why should I care?*

**Male Citizen 2**  
  *Life here is good and all…  But it’s not enough\!  I really want to travel, and explore these sunken ruins\!  I feel like the possibilities are endless…  and yet…  I am stuck here while all my ambitions slip away…  Circumstances have made the choice for me…*

  *My coat is from the south tower\!  It cost my dad a lot of biomass to go over there and get it…  But it was well worth it\!  Those simple people there…  They are just more connected with the light, yeah…  I just totally embody their culture…  I am one of them at heart\!*

**Lazy Soldier**  
  *I am so bored\!  Why can’t something exciting happen for a change?*  

	**The Lighthouse \- Route 2**

**Thoughtful Engineer**  
  *Oh\!  Hello there?  Did you get through the incongruously installed barrier?  It seems not even we are the first here, friend.   And whoever did (was?) took some souvenirs…*

**Engineer 1**  
  *I can’t quite understand it…  But some of the programming code in these terminals…  Is identical to sections of a biomass workstation…  What the hell is the purpose of this thing?*

**Engineer 2**  
  *The data we found in a felled drone…  It’s all in here…  But slightly different?  Many iterations of it…  Hmmmm…*

**Engineer 3**  
  *The south tower researchers were most helpful\!  Since the captain returned with their notes…  We have been able to venture deeper…*

**Engineer 4**  
  *I am not sure yet…  But it seems that the data scanned by the drones…  It’s all stirpped and stored within.  It’s just that it’s so much data\!  Down to the molecular level…  It stirs an unutterable loathing within me…*

**Engineer 5**  
  *It is happening again…*

**Engineer 6**  
  *No, no, no…  I must be making a mistake here…  I can’t be reading this right…  I just can’t…*

**Engineer 7**  
  *Huh…  If I am interpreting this correctly…  A new module within just activated…  it’s almost like a remote module…  I could notice faint activity before…  but all of a sudden it’s deafening.* 

	**West Tower (lightless)**

**Filled Pod**  
  *…who I hurt… …is who I am… …and who I am… …is who I hurt…*

**Hybrid Engineer**  
  *…you…  …you look familiar…  I…I…could not get out in time?  …can’t quite remember…  …they put me here…  …they were blue…  …but I was dying in a strange place…  …stabbed by a hood…  …that can’t be right…  …I am not here…*  
	\*can not explain this… \*

	**Transit Tunnels (lightless)**

**Filled Pod**  
  *…and I’ll be another one…  …and you’ll be another one…  …and soon we’ll be one…*

	**Abandoned Cache**

**Light Deprived**  
  *…I remember my memories…  …I remember his memories…  …I remember her memories…  …I remember its memories…*

	**Drifters Den \- Route 3**

**Bartender**   
  *Hey there, friend.  We have a crowded house right now…  Our supplies are getting kinda low I am afraid…*

**Castlevania Dude**  
  *Oy there lad, don’t be shy\!  The more the merrier I say.  Especially if you’re the chatty type.  Those red fellas are just keepin’ to themselves.  Would be interesting to hear what they got to say.*  

**Red 1**  
  *I would have loved to have gone to the shore…  But I wasn’t assigned and there was nothing I could do…  At least I can drown my sorrows here…*

**Red/Pallid Hybrid**  
  *Stuck for the moment…  We were ambushed and some of us scrambled back here…  Luckily, we managed to swipe one of the blues’ uniforms…  When our man by the port is ready he’ll be able to sneak through…*

**Hammer Lady**  
  *You think it’s crowded now, boy?  You should have seen it before\!  Much more of those red bastards around…  Very different ambiance now for sure…*

**Red 2**  
  *I can’t stand some people…  Those who think there’s something inherently special about them…  Those who take pride in things they were born into…  Those who look down on others in unfortunate circumstances…  Don’t they realize they would turn out the same in that environment?  In the end, we are all just biomass…*

**Red 3**  
  *I am used to absorbing a lot more light…  I never even spent this much time in the tunnels hunting for biomass…  I hope we can get home soon.*

**Red 4**  
  *I’ve always had a bad feeling about those blue bastards…  I just know they are doing something bad to the villagers here…  Anyway, with their uniform I’ll be able to ride the elevator…  And infiltrate their ranks…  Hehehehe.*

	**East Tower \- Peak \- Route 3**

**Enemy Blues**  
  *I have no patience for that lackey sent by the west…  If one of those bastard reds took him out…  I would not be too unhappy about it\!*

  *The best fuel…  Is still living…  As they grow more deprived of light…  The flesh gets more combustible…  Until it goes hollow and pallid.*

  *The lights inside our masks…  Pain my brain and fill me with rage…  It’s better than the alternative I suppose…*

  *The cattle we’ll herd from the south tower…  Will provide fuel for the furnace for a long time…*

  *The old man has lost his marbles…  Do we really believe that he can turn off the lighthouse?*

  *I can’t believe how quickly we went through them…  When I first arrived here…  The farming had only just commenced.  The village was packed to the brim.*

  *Mind your own business\!*

  *Comrade, we’ll finally show those swine…  Up in their light bathed tower…  We’ll expose them for the vermin they are…*  

  *With most of their elite guard by the shore…  And our new equipment provided by the west…  We should be able to steamroll through their defenses…  There’s so many residents here though…  We need them to be light deprived…  In their disorientation…  Packing them in pods won’t be an issue.*

  *Not long now, comrade…  When the light is gone…  The south tower will be ripe for the farming…*

  *If we take some prisoners…  I think the abandoned warehouse would (be) ideal…  Ah, yes.  Should we get rid of the abomination there?  Doesn’t matter much either way\!*

  *No one believes me…  But I saw a drone crash through the village…  It was near the bottom…  So I wasn’t going anywhere near\!*

  *I’ve heard the old man has a new lackey…  Not quite human, not quite pallid…  Not quite living…  not quite dead…  A puppet of sorts…  How does he pull its strings?*

  *I fell asleep in the village…  And I had the strangest dream…  It seemed to go on forever…*

  *Oooof…  Things are definitely harder now…  Herding the scum below into pods was easy…  Fighting those red bastards is not\!*

**Drifter**  
  *Brother\!  I was hoping our paths would cross once again.  I have slayed the beast here for you.  Ah, but why the sad disposition?  Don’t tell me…  It’s because you were denied the sport of battle?  Hue hue hue hue hue\!  Perhaps you shouldn’t have made an allegiance…  with such an efficient killer such as I\!  Oh, brother.*

	**South Tower \- Route 3**

**Surviving Settler 1**  
  **(Blue outfit)**  *…no…  …get back\!*  
  **(Other)**  *…They all came at once…  …starting herding us down the tunnels…  …the Red Mother held them off…  …she went to find the leaders behind the attack…  …I don’t think she will survive by herself…*  
    
**Surviving Settler 2**  
  **(Blue outfit)**  *…no…  …get back\!*  
  **(Other)**  *…please…  …help them…  …or our settlement won’t survive…*

**Surviving Settler 3**  
  **(Blue outfit)**  *…no…  …get back\!*  
  **(Other)**  *…no…  …this can’t be happening…  …not to us…  ….not to our settlement…*

**Surviving Settler 4**  
  **(Blue outfit)**  *…no…  …get back\!*  
  **(Other)**  *…I heard them…  …whispering horrible things…  …it can’t be true…*

**Surviving Settler 5**  
  **(Blue outfit)**  *…no…  …get back\!*  
  **(Other)**  *…I had to do it…  …don’t judge me, please…  …if you knew what my fate would have been…  …I didn’t have a choice…*

**Surviving Settler 6**  
  *My grandmother would often recount the tale…*  
	\*same dialogue as lady settler 5 in south tower \- settlement\*

**Blue Captain**  
  *Rest in peace, old girl.*

**Duke’s Left Hand**  
  *Why did you interfere?  Your intrusion was neither needed nor required…*  
    
**Engineer Sister 1**  
  *We didn’t need to do much…  Just a few tweaks then it seems to have fixed itself…  Seems like there is no going back from where it wants to go…*

**Engineer Sister 2**  
  *I’ve never seen one so up close…  It’s so beautiful…  It fills me with an overwhelming sense of nostalgia…*

	**The Lighthouse \- Route 3**

**Drifter**  
  **(if you helped him)**  *Ah, brother\!  Our acquaintance may be fresh…  But I feel a close bond between us…  Perhaps you know the reason why?  Hue hue hue hue hue\!  Yes…  You are my friend.  Which is why I haven’t struck you down…  And makes me reconsider my pact…  Yes…  It will be your choice…  My travels have led me  to unfathomable truths…  truths that will be forgotten…  if the process is completed.  Things will move forward…  And in my weakness…  I fear what might arise from change…  I will accept your choice…  You seem like you’ve experienced enough…  The hour is getting late…*

  **(if you don’t talk to him earlier)**  *Hello there.  We haven’t yet had the pleasure to make acquaintance…  Though your presence fills me with a curious nostalgia…  I am but a humble drifter…  Through my travels I have been privy to some truths…  Horrible, unfathomable truths…  You would not be able to appreciate their worth…  My burden is heavy…  I fear my visions for the final end…  And so will not turn my back on this world.  I must command you to yield.  I cannot allow you the choice…  You’ll have to seize it from me.*

**Items**

  Beamsaber  
*A concentrated stream of light is the ideal catalyst of stubborn pallid flesh.  A little light can keep you together, but too much can tear you apart.*

  Familiar Hat  
*The perfect accessory to complete a familiar look.*

  Familiar Garments  
*Timeless robes that invoke a familiar feeling.*

  Symbiotic Catalyst  
*Stomp your feet when things aren’t going your way and get partial streak charge.  Your new internal friend will rejuvenate near a workstation.*

  Grenade  
*Ideal for taking out groups or hostiles below you.*

  Pistol  
*Standard firearm with limited range.  Not very effective against pallids \- but more so against other pests.*

  Prototype Repair  
*Unlike your inbuilt repair system,  these ones are consumable and work at a much slower rate.  Will recover up to 50% of health while in use.*  
    
  Agility Plus  
*Temporarily increases the volatility of your cells, granting you extra speed at the expense of your vulnerability.*

  Battering Ram  
*Useful for those who prefer a little distance between them and their enemy.*

  Rope Wheel Mod  
*Secure you in place before propelling you through ropes in no time.  Almost makes your arms obsolete.* 

  Sulfuric Catalyst  
*Emphasizes the sulfuric component of your biomass byproduct, increasing your projectile damage by 2x for a limited time.*

  Pallid Spear  
\-

  Stability Plus  
*Temporarily shift your centre of gravity to your feet, making you slow but un-staggerable.*

  Red Sentry Hat  
*One size fits all.*

  Red Rookie Garments  
*Loose, patched up garments passed down from one poor soul to another.*

  Lead Pilus Mod  
*Extra weight on your cells makes you immovable without your explicit command.*

  Claya  
*Temporarily compresses your cells to greatly enhance your strength.*

  Uzi  
\-

  Reflektor  
*Use a little stamina to reverse the polarity of an incoming projectile and find out if your enemies can take what they dish out.*

  Gunner’s Heaven Mod  
*The filtration on your byproduct is greatly reduced, offering more potency for your projectiles at the cost of sharply reducing your strength.*

  Broken Welder  
*Configured to open one last switch.  Aside from that, good luck getting more use out of it.  The molten discharge might prove useful though.*

  Hedge Cutter  
*Ideal for those looking to sadistically terrorise their fose before tearing them limb from limb.*

  Shotgun  
*Provides great stopping power, though it’s slightly unwieldy nature may prove troublesome.*

  Rapier  
*The craftsmanship on this blade is a step up from most other beam weapons.  Made up of rare components out of reach to all but a very few.*

  Synaptic Reroute Mod  
*Reroutes your synaptic network to increase your streak charging ability by constantly draining your cell byproduct.* 

  Drone Blade  
*Scrapped from a drone that did not make it back to the lighthouse.  The space around it seems to corrupt and repel anything near.*

  Lactate Catalyst Mod  
*Reprograms your cells functions to allow more efficient stamina use at the cost of increased vulnerability when taking damage.*

  Detailed Map  
\-

  Aristocrat’s Garb  
*Immaculate hand woven threads for combat.  Seems like they have been abandoned for some time.*

  Meridian Crown  
*A wandering distortion generated from corrupted sync data.*

  Battle Bandana  
*Heavy with the burden of responsibility to live up to its previous owner.*

  Dagger  
*For when you want to add more visceral flair to your kills.*

  Intimidator  
*Though the blade is razor thin, the concentration of light makes it unwieldable for most.*

  Sentinel’s Helmet  
*Very light so it won’t do much to protect your head, but at least your identity will be obscured when committing unsavory actions.*

  Rusted Steel  
*An old heirloom with an inscription that reads “For even in exile, the nobles will stand against the tyranny of the many”.*

  Permeable Membrane  
*With time, everything falls apart.  With a little light, however, a fragile connection may remain.  Reduced damage by half, but streak multiplier is set to zero.* 

  Flintlock  
*Looks cool, doesn’t it?*

  Distilled Ethanol  
*Near identical to the byproduct of your cells, will power your firearms and special actions for a limited time.*

  Dextochrome Mod  
*A mysterious substance that will boost your reactive faculties but greatly lower your defence.*

  Aestus Mod  
*Using a max charge will leave you with a basic charge ready for use.  However, streak multiplier is lowered while a repair is ready.*

  Ion Fusion Mod  
*Infusion ion particles into your smart cells, creating a spark on a dive at the cost of invincibility frames.*

  Landsmith  
*Creates a crushing blunt blow that can also clear any fragile ground.*

  Vampire’s Kiss Mod  
*Your cells repair themselves when kinetic damage is done to others, though the constant thirst for more causes gradual damage until near death.*

  Beam Spear  
*The first beam weapon, it was reverse engineered from the bygone metropolitans barriers.*

  Double Beamsabre  
*Bulkier than a standard Beamsabre, as wielding more light is not a weightless endeavor.*  

  Nameless Combat Gear  
*Looks like it was constructed from the remnants of a different blue uniform.*

  Nameless Volt  
*Surprisingly light and comfortable.  Shaped in a way that allows drinking and eating.  Do you even need that?*

  Discus  
*A specialised weapon that seems like it was adapted from a greater whole.*

  Scythe  
*Takes some momentum to swing properly.  As punishing as it is intimidating.*

**Meta Lore**

  \*The following was a developer response to some questions found in the games official discord lore section.   I feel it contains critical information for unraveling the story.\*

“I just want to say that I have really enjoyed reading the theories in the lore speculation thread. I don't want to discourage the discussion there by giving definitive answers to what things are and what they mean even though I had concrete purpose and meanings in my design. With that said, I will do my best to point you in the right direction with your questions and maybe outright give you answers if I don't think it ruins speculation\! I am happy hinting a few things that might not be possible to ascertain just from the game. To start off, initially the game was going to take place at the outskirts of the city, and you made your way into a rural village that would act as a hub of sorts. At one point in development, I decided that my idea was too disorganized and instead thought it would be better to use my initial concept as a past cycle that had previously occurred. 

**Why did people leave the mountains and go back to the cities?**  
  The vast majority of the characters you encounter have never lived in the city before the stars fell from the sky. They only arrived after the stars fell from the sky, drawn by the beacon of the lighthouse. They are all refugees from the mountains. 

**Where did the metropolitans go?**  
  They lived their lives like any other civilization. In time, everything must pass.

**Were they killed by the falling stars?**  
  No. They built the lighthouse in anticipation of this. 

**Did they really cause them to fall?**  
  If they had the power to affect them, they surely would still be burning. (edited)

**What is the relationship between drones and the lighthouse?**  
  You might find a parallel process ocurring in game, though in a more compact manner. 

**What is their relationship with corruption since the Blade Drone is the one that activates corruption in us?**   
  The only thing that can corrupt is age and time... 

**How did Distorced Man come about?**  
  And what does it have to do with Loop in the game? I had bigger plans for the distorted man in the game but at a certain point I decided to make lots of cuts as otherwise I wasn't sure if I would be able to finish the game without completely losing motivation. However, these plans might come to fruition at a later date, so I wont say much here. However, from a mechanical and gameplay point of view I'll say that it was very much inspired by the SA-X in Metroid Fusion and your encounter with the Burning Man in MGSV's intro. 

**Did the soldiers at East Tower keep that pale man as a prisoner because he was so highly evolved and to use him as a weapon?**   
  I take it you are talking about the POW boss fight? You might notice that its not that unique compared to other enemies. 

**Are the names used as variables for the NPCs in the game their real names?**  
  *Like Chaval and Soshoona?* I tried to avoid names as much as possible in the game...Chaval was a nickname for a friend I had, and Shoshanna came from Inglorious Basterds which is one of my favourite movies. 

**What are angels? Do they have anything to do with the pale?**  
  Angels come from heaven\! That's all I'll say, heh. (edited)”  
  

**Current Theory/Musings**

  \*\*This section is just some personal notes and musings.  Read it if you’re curious but some of it is ‘outdated’ in the sense that I might not think those things anymore.\*\*  
    
  The stars falling from the sky were asteroids or some other cataclysmic event (not really important) I henceforth refer to as ‘The Cataclysm’.  In anticipation of this the Metropolitans constructed the lighthouse \- An extremely scaled up version of the biomass workstations.  They constructed drones to fly around their city and collect as much data on everything and as much biomass as possible.  They then programmed the drones to fly that data/biomass into the eye of the lighthouse so they could be assimilated and used to reconstruct the city and the metropolitans in their full glory but there was some kind of problem. They managed to assimilate themselves and became the angels we see at the lighthouse but perhaps they were unable to collect enough biomass to recreate their physical forms and the physical city and so the lighthouse is stuck waiting for more biomass?  Or perhaps some kind of special biomass is needed which is why the PC specifically is the one to trigger the lighthouse to ‘progress’?  Perhaps, because everyone/thing has stagnated and become corrupted, they cannot be used anymore?  In any case the lighthouse (or perhaps the consciousness of the metropolitans within it) realised there was some kind of problem and created a ‘process’ to solve it.  This so-called ‘process’ seems to be creating some type of cycle or ‘world reset’ to prevent the world from decaying or corrupting completely before the lighthouse is done doing whatever it is it’s doing.

  In any case, there is much evidence to suggest the cataclysm caused a large deluge, a flood of biblical proportions.  The area around the lighthouse is called ‘the flood’ and obviously is largely water you walk on there.  The settlers speak of their ancestors ‘docking their boats’ when they first arrived.  The fact that the main areas you visit are ‘towers’ (exception: west tower being underground.  Needs more exploration but it kind of looks like it’s inside a submarine?) and you use boats to travel between them.

  \*possible theory:  the impact created smog or somehow ‘blocked the sun’ and the lighthouse became an artificial sun?  Could explain why the settlers were drawn to Metropolis.\*  
    
  The cataclysm and the flood pretty much reset humanity and mostly killed everything off.  The humans who did survive seem to have done so because they lived in the mountains and were able to avoid the flood.  They were likely a tribal people, perhaps hunter/gatherers but in any case were much less technologically advanced than the metropolitans and at some point after the cataclysm left the mountains and sailed to the east tower and began to populate Metropolis.

  Civilization began to re-emerge, with the peoples splitting into factions that populated the different towers.  Some attempted to learn from the metropolitan technology like the east and west towers while others like the south tower chose to follow a more spiritual path.  Life carried on but the people were obviously curious about the lighthouse and the rest of Metropolis and began to study and research it’s technology.  Some of the smarter people learned enough to know there is some kind of cycle occuring.  The people of west tower, for example, all seem to be aware of the cycle and even hold ‘anniversary parties’ to celebrate it.  This does not seem to bother them but there are others that seem to be driven insane by it.

  \*possible theory:  the ones who are going insane are maybe ones that actually remember their previous cycle(s) while the ones who are not bothered simply know the cycle exists?  The PC seems to somehow ‘glitch’ the cycle and retain his memories and items from each iteration of it which allows us to ‘solve’ the cycle and progress the process.  The insane ones are all partial pallids (or at least light depriveds)  from memory and the player character also seems to be partially pallid.  Perhaps something about being a hybrid allows cross cycle memory retention?  More exploration needed.\*

  At some point the cycle became too old (possibly from recycling the same biomass over and over) and the Corruption emerged (possible mutations in the genetic code?), causing those deprived of the lighthouses light to turn extremely pale and sickly.  This is where the term ‘Pallid’ comes from, and this is exactly what the light depraved become in the final stage of their mutation \- the purple pallid monsters that inhabit the dark areas of the game (transit tunnels, east tower tunnels, post light areas after being rejected by the meridian gate).  Concerned by this the engineers (led by or including the Duke) began to study the lighthouse and the pallid in an attempt to ‘cure’ the corruption.

 **Mysteries/Notes**

   \*\*This section is just some personal notes and musings.  Read it if you’re curious but some of it is ‘outdated’ in the sense that I might not think those things anymore.\*\*

  **Who/what is the player character?**  
\-Human/Pallid hybrid? \*beam saber text\*  
\-Biomass clone of Old Man Engineer?  
\-Script or code written by Old Man Engineer to reboot The Lighthouse after it’s turned off?  
\-Is the PC significant to the meridian sequence/gate or will anyone do?  
  \*one engineer in path 2 version of The Lighthouse talks about a ‘remote module’ activating in the code of The Lighthouse as you approach.  Suggests PC is very significant.\*

  **The Lighthouse**  
\-An engineer there says the data is almost the same as the biomass workstations and another one says the lighthouse contains the data of the drones (and many iterations of it).  
\-Another engineer there says it contains data of things ‘down to the molecular level’.  
  \*suggests actual 3D printing of Biomass entities is possible.\*

  **The Meridian Sequence**  
\-What the hell is happening when you enter?  Time travel?  System reboot?  Full biomass remake of metropolis?  The answer hinges on or perhaps determines what kind of world we inhabit.  How can you explain the loop?  Everything seems to suggest biomass remake via the lighthouse/drones EXCEPT the meridian sequence which seemingly suggests a simulation reboot (corroborated by the Old Man Engineer saying the people in this world are ‘long gone’ and just ‘memory’.  Really sounds like a computer but nothing else suggests this.

  **The Metropolitans**  
\-Did they start the cycle?  If so, why?  
  \*Speculation:  They did and they did so to avoid the cataclysm by creating The Lighthouse.\*  
\-Did they become the Angels?  If The Lighthouse is reprinting physical things then why don’t the **Metropolitans reprint themselves?**    
  \*Speculation:  Perhaps they couldn’t quite finish The Lighthouse in time, or didn’t know how,  and so created a cycle which repeats with hopes of a future generation figuring out the code needed for The Process to ‘progress’.  Still doesn’t explain why they don’t just reprint themselves until they figure it out and the same quandary can be found in the digital simulation theory too.  If they are just rebooting a digital simulation and everything is data \- the angels exist as data already \- then why couldn’t they themselves be rebooted?\*

  **The Distortion**  
\-Seems to be different than the pallid ‘corruption’ as the corruption appears to be organic while the distortion appears to be some kind of digital or dimensional anomaly?  It is only really present with the ‘distorted man’ and areas he’s been to although the distorted man also seems to cause corruption especially, or perhaps specifically, in the PC.  More exploration needed.

  **Duke’s Left Hand**  
\-Starts in Duke’s Manor and goes to East Tower.  
\-In East Tower to assassinate Red Mother?  Part of the betrayal plan?

  **Mysterious Stranger**  
\-Where does he go after you help him and what is he trying to do?  
  \*addendum:  I think he’s the dude with the Duke’s Left Hand attacking red mother in route 3\*  
\-Ex-Blue?  
  \*probably still Blue but lies to you to get your help.\*

  **The Cycle**  
\-What exactly happens during each cycle?  
  \*speculation:  Drones gather data \> drones upload to lighthouse \> lighthouse absorbs everything and 3d prints a new iteration.\*  
\-Does The Duke shutting off The Lighthouse cause The Lighthouse to initiate The Process?  
 \-Is the cycle the same thing as or related to The Meridian Sequence?  
  \*Speculation:  The Cycle is separate from The Meridian Sequence.  The Meridian Sequence was created by the Old Man Engineer to subvert The Duke’s plans of stopping the cycle.  PC is a script written by Old Man Engineer that, when uploaded, reboots the lighthouse and allows the cycle to continue.\*  
\-Some NPCs are aware of the cycle.  This does not bother some (ie. west tower citizens) but drives others insane (Light Deprived smashing their heads and such spouting vague and cryptic prose about remembering things)?  
  \*speculation:  Corruption and errors in recreating Biomass entities results in things being ‘kept’ from previous cycles such as memories and the PCs items.\*

  **The Drones**  
\-Lady with the drone in South Tower says it looks ‘ancient’ even compared to most metropolitan tech.  
\-A lady in South Tower Settlement talks about her grandma’s story of the ‘drones swarming the sky’ the day before the ‘stars fell’.  Part of the cycle?
